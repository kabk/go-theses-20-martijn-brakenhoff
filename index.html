          ...I just arrived at my camp spot in the middle of nowhere when two men show up together with the most muscular dog I have ever seen, their faces covered with black smudges. I estimate them to be in their late twenties or early thirties. Because of their dirty appearance my first guess was that they were homeless, however they explain that they work in a garage and ask me if they can join me to enjoy the beautiful view of the camp spot. I tell them they are welcome to join…
          <br><br>
          ...They bring out some booze and start drinking and friendly ask me if I would like some to. I politely decline. Despite their rough appearance they were actually were very nice. A little later they pull out a bag of hasj from their jacket and start smoking it. After finishing the joint a bag filled white powder comes from one of their pockets. It’s speed. After skillfully shaping the power into lines on the screen of his phone they start snorting it up. Again they friendly ask me if I would like some to, and again I decline…
          <br><br>
          … at this point one of them is visibly drunk, His face turning into and unnatural green. They came by car And at this point I’m a bit worried that I will be stuck with these high and drunk car mechanics in the middle of nowhere. At some point the drunk guy goes in the bushes to puke and doesn't come back. It turned out he passed out behind the shelter. His friend convinces me that he is fine.

      Introduction</div>

      <div class="text">

      <p>
      I’ve always enjoined cycling, and every now and then I would fantasise with a friend about making an epic bicycle trip to some place beautiful and remote. Like most of these kinds of fantasies they never happened, due lack of time, money, equipment etc. After learning the disappointed news that I had to redo the final year of my graphic design study I suddenly had a lot of time on my hands. It felt like I spend too much time in school the past three years and motivation was running low, I drastically needed a reboot. I figured a good break and some time away from the school environment would do me good. Now, with half a year of nothing in front of me there were no more excuses and I decided to make it happen. I took a job to save up for some equipment and eventually scavenged all the gear together that I was going to need for my journey. The destination was from the beginning very clear: Sweden. I have never been to Sweden before, but in my mind it is a land of wilderness, filled with endless pine forests, enormous lakes, and pristine nature. I roughly came up with a route that I wanted to cycle. A line that led me from Germany via Denmark to Sweden with as final destination Stockholm, and from the Swedish capital back home.
      </p>
      <p>
      For five weeks I was by myself, sleeping on a tin matt, in a tent somewhere in the forests of Sweden. I cycled for hours every day. When I finished my trip I was physically drained, the repetitive movements I made while peddling resulted in a knee injury, I was physically exhausted and was thinner that I had ever been in my adult life. On paper it doesn’t sound that relaxing and despite all that I felt like I was reborn. My mind felt clear and I felt better than I had felt in a long time. Ever since I got back I can’t help to wonder why? I never really camped much before, not even as a child. My parents are very much into travelling but always liked some kind of luxury when going on holidays. After all you go on vacation to relax and not to put yourself through stress and discomfort. Why did I feel this strong urge to engulf myself in nature? Maybe it was just because it was an escape from the troubles I had back home, but I feel there is more to it. I could have picked a beach on some tropical island. Why did it feel so good?
