  …It was my second day in Sweden today. I found a beautiful place in the woods to sleep. I slept like a baby until I woke up in the middle of the night because of a loud and terrifying scream…
  <br>
  <br>
  …The sound came from something that was standing right next to my tent. Still dizzy and disorientated from waking up from a deep sleep I tried to identify the source of the sound. The impact of its feet gave away that it was some kind of big animal. Curious yet terrified I was contemplating if I should take a peak or that it was maybe saver to stay put. Without success I tried to look through the small ventilation holes of my tent to see if I could see something moving. It was pitch black outside. I decided to stay put and wait for It to leave. After waiting for what seemed like an hour the animal finally decided to move along…
  <br>
  <br>
  …The next morning I heard the same sound again. This time coming from a little further away. It was light this time and this time I decided to inspect. It turned out it was a small deer, not much bigger than a large size dog. Feeling a bit fooled I continued my journey…

  <br>
  …So far I have been very lucky with public restrooms. In scandinavia there are many of them. This time however, there were no restrooms to be seen in miles, basically leaving the wild as my only remaining option to relieve myself. Unfortunately I found myself in the middle of farm land with barely any vegetation at all…
  <br>
  <br>
  …I forgot how desperate you can feel when you are in need of a toilet but there are none around. I’d been holding it up to the point that my stomach started cramping, when finally a small patch of trees showed up. It could have been the only opportunity in the next few hours. I felt super vulnerable, If anyone passed by there is not much I could have done, they would had to watch me finish. After I was finished I felt the most intense feeling of relief I have ever felt...

  …In Denmark it is not allowed to camp anywhere you want like in Sweden. Fortunately as an alternative to wild camping they have designated campsites scattered all over the country where you can camp for free. I found one of these free spots near the city of Aalborg where I could stay for the night. The place however was not what it seemed…
  <br>
  <br>
  …It was a beautiful place with a view over the water, but it turned out it was also a place for homosexuals to meet and “have fun”. After I left the place in a hurry and overcoming the shock of my very unexpected view the price of the replacement camping didn’t seem so bad after all…

  ...I am in Germany, and very close to home. I ate all my food the evening before, so my first goal of the day was to do groceries. It turned out that all supermarkets were closed. I forgot that it is pinksteren today and I can’t get food anywhere. The only shops that are open seem to be gas stations where they only sell candy and sodas. Despite this setback I managed to cover my longest distances so far. 180 km on a diet almost exclusively containing doritos and snickers...

  <h1>Insights on Outdoor Experiences</h1>

  <p class="text">  I’ve always enjoined cycling, and every now and then I would fantasise with a friend about making an epic bicycle trip to some place beautiful and remote. Like most of these kinds of fantasies they never happened, due lack of time, money, equipment etc. After learning the disappointed news that I had to redo the final year of my graphic design study I suddenly had a lot of time on my hands. It felt like I spend too much time in school the past three years and motivation was running low, I drastically needed a reboot. I figured a good break and some time away from the school environment would do me good. Now, with half a year of nothing in front of me there were no more excuses and I decided to make it happen. I took a job to save up for some equipment and eventually scavenged all the gear together that I was going to need for my journey. The destination was from the beginning very clear: Sweden. I have never been to Sweden before, but in my mind it is a land of wilderness, filled with endless pine forests, enormous lakes, and pristine nature. I roughly came up with a route that I wanted to cycle. A line that led me from Germany via Denmark to Sweden with as final destination Stockholm, and from the Swedish capital back home.
  <br><br>
  For five weeks I was by myself, sleeping on a thin matt, in a tent somewhere in the forests of Sweden. I cycled for hours every day. When I finished my trip I was physically drained, the repetitive movements I made while peddling resulted in a knee injury, I was physically exhausted and was thinner that I had ever been in my adult life. On paper it doesn’t sound that relaxing and despite all that I felt like I was reborn. My mind felt clear and I felt better than I had felt in a long time. Ever since I got back I can’t help to wonder why? I never really camped much before, not even as a child. My parents are very much into travelling but always liked some kind of luxury when going on holidays. After all you go on vacation to relax and not to put yourself through stress and discomfort. Why did I feel this strong urge to engulf myself in nature? Maybe it was just because it was an escape from the troubles I had back home, but I feel there is more to it. I could have picked a beach on some tropical island. Why did it feel so good?
