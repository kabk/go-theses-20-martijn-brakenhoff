  …It was my second day in Sweden today. I found a beautiful place in the woods to sleep. I slept like a baby until I woke up in the middle of the night because of a loud and terrifying scream…
  <br>
  <br>
  …The sound came from something that was standing right next to my tent. Still dizzy and disorientated from waking up from a deep sleep I tried to identify the source of the sound. The impact of its feet gave away that it was some kind of big animal. Curious yet terrified I was contemplating if I should take a peak or that it was maybe saver to stay put. Without success I tried to look through the small ventilation holes of my tent to see if I could see something moving. It was pitch black outside. I decided to stay put and wait for It to leave. After waiting for what seemed like an hour the animal finally decided to move along…
  <br>
  <br>
  …The next morning I heard the same sound again. This time coming from a little further away. It was light this time and this time I decided to inspect. It turned out it was a small deer, not much bigger than a large size dog. Feeling a bit fooled I continued my journey…

  …So far I have been very lucky with public restrooms. In scandinavia there are many of them. This time however, there were no restrooms to be seen in miles, basically leaving the wild as my only remaining option to relieve myself. Unfortunately I found myself in the middle of farm land with barely any vegetation at all…
  <br>
  <br>
  …I forgot how desperate you can feel when you are in need of a toilet but there are none around. I’d been holding it up to the point that my stomach started cramping, when finally a small patch of trees showed up. It could have been the only opportunity in the next few hours. I felt super vulnerable, If anyone passed by there is not much I could have done, they would had to watch me finish. After I was finished I felt the most intense feeling of relief I have ever felt...

  …In Denmark it is not allowed to camp anywhere you want like in Sweden. Fortunately as an alternative to wild camping they have designated campsites scattered all over the country where you can camp for free. I found one of these free spots near the city of Aalborg where I could stay for the night. The place however was not what it seemed…
  <br>
  <br>
  …It was a beautiful place with a view over the water, but it turned out it was also a place for homosexuals to meet and “have fun”. After I left the place in a hurry and overcoming the shock of my very unexpected view the price of the replacement camping didn’t seem so bad after all…

  ...I am in Germany, and very close to home. I ate all my food the evening before, so my first goal of the day was to do groceries. It turned out that all supermarkets were closed. I forgot that it is pinksteren today and I can’t get food anywhere. The only shops that are open seem to be gas stations where they only sell candy and sodas. Despite this setback I managed to cover my longest distances so far. 180 km on a diet almost exclusively containing doritos and snickers...

  <h1>Insights on Outdoor Experiences</h1>

<!-- Hoofdstuk1 -->
  <p class="naam"> by Martijn Brakenhoff</p>

  <p class="text">  I’ve always enjoined cycling, and every now and then I would fantasise with a friend about making an epic bicycle trip to some place beautiful and remote. Like most of these kinds of fantasies they never happened, due lack of time, money, equipment etc. After learning the disappointing news that I had to redo the final year of my graphic design study I suddenly had a lot of time on my hands. It felt like I spend too much time in school the past three years and motivation was running low, I drastically needed a reboot. I figured a good break and some time away from the school environment would do me good. Now, with half a year of nothing in front of me there were no more excuses and I decided to make it happen. I took a job to save up for some equipment and eventually scavenged all the gear together that I was going to need for my journey. The destination was from the beginning very clear: Sweden. I have never been to Sweden before, but in my mind it is a land of wilderness, filled with endless pine forests, enormous lakes, and pristine nature. I roughly came up with a route that I wanted to cycle. A line that led me from Germany via Denmark to Sweden with as final destination Stockholm, and from the Swedish capital back home.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  For five weeks I was by myself, sleeping on a thin matt, in a tent somewhere in the forests of Sweden. I cycled for hours every day. When I finished my trip I was physically drained, the repetitive movements I made while peddling resulted in a knee injury, I was physically exhausted and was thinner that I had ever been in my adult life. On paper it doesn’t sound that relaxing and despite all that I felt like I was reborn. My mind felt clear and I felt better than I had felt in a long time. Ever since I got back I can’t help to wonder why? I never really camped much before, not even as a child. My parents are very much into travelling but always liked some kind of luxury when going on holidays. After all you go on vacation to relax and not to put yourself through stress and discomfort. Why did I feel this strong urge to immerse myself in nature? Maybe it was just because it was an escape from the troubles I had back home, but I feel there is more to it. I could have picked a beach on some tropical island.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  I would like to know what we can find in these kind of outdoor experiences that we are missing in our modern daily lives. We live in a world in which new inventions are being introduced everyday to make our lives more pleasurable, easier and healthier. So why did it feel so good?

  <h1>Natural healthcare</h1>
  <p class="text">  After doing a quick search on Google I found multiple researches that were conducted by multiple institutions that proved that nature is in fact healthy. All these studies concluded indeed that being exposed to nature in one way or the other is healthy for a human being.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  In the study Levels of Nature and Stress Response they let volunteers stay in environments with different levels of nature, A forrest, a municipal park, and an urban built exercise facility. before and after the visits the amount of stress in their bodies was tested. They concluded that vististation to locations with the highest level of nature had the most impact regarding the reduction of stress.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  It is also know that spatial openness can help with the healing of eyesight. In Europe, half of the people in their twenties have bad eyesight and the numbers are increasing. The cause is the staring at objects that are close to you, like smartphones. The eyes have to put a lot of effort into focusing and the blue light that the screen is radiating makes it even harder. If you stare into the distance the lens of your eye can relax again. Therefore nature environment are good for your eyes because they often possess spatial openness.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  It is proven that going to the beach has multiple health benefits. The sound of ebbing and flowing of the seawater de-stimulates our brain. The noises together with the sight of the ocean activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for slowing us down and therefore helps us to relax. The smell of water is also a factor that helps to stay in this meditative state. Studies suggest that the air close to places like the ocean and waterfalls are filled with negative ions. These oxygen atoms have an extra electron which could be beneficial to treat symptoms of seasonal affective disorder.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  Spending time in the sun is important because the sun is our main source of vitamin D. Which we need to extract calcium from the food we eat. Which in turn is necessary to maintain healthy bones and teeth. Vitamin D also play a role in maintaining a healthy immune system and the use of our muscles.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  So I there are many studies conducted that conclude that nature is healthy for mind and body. There are a couple of hypothesis that could explain the positive effect.  Natural environments have been linked to the Attention Restoration Theory (ART). The Art theory says that natural environments posses a particular properties that promote restoration from attention fatigue. Similar to ART, the psycho-evolutionary theory (PET), says that natural environments are excellent for reducing stress levels because they offer specific attributes like water and spatial openness. these attributes are said to have big influence on us because we evolved in similar surroundings.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  Although this all these examples are all very interesting they don’t really satisfy me. I’m not doubting the integrity of these researches. I’m sure the ions in the air contribute to my health and that the reason why lies deep into our mind and body, But I’m not a biologist and I need an answer that is more comprehensible. Besides, these studies only partially give me an answer to my question. I had quite a lot of these soothing moments during my trip that were very relaxing and filled with sunshine and joy. But as I mentioned in earlier, my nature experience had some moments of discomfort as well. In this essay I want to continue to investigate what made me like the trip so much. I will do this by analysing the nature experiences of others and compare theirs to my own. In turn I will dive into the theoretical research to strengthen.

  <h1>A place for real experiences</h1>
  <p class="text">  Two friends of mine, that I know since high school, made a similar trip to Sweden shortly after I finished mine. They didn’t travel around like I did, instead they picked a place to park their car and hiked into the forest until they found a place where they made camp. Inspired by survival videos they viewed on YouTube.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  I’m very well aware of the Youtube survival community. I have been captivated by the fenomenon for a long time, and have watched many of these videos myself before I left. In these videos people show tutorials on how to survive in the wild with minimal tools and resources. Maybe one of the most well known youtube channels is Primitive Technology in which a man is making tools with his bare hands, only using resources he finds in the nature around him. Another good friend of mine showed me Erik Normak. Normak is a Swedish filmmaker that documents his travels in the Swedish outback. His videos rapidly became some of my favourites. He shows the extreme and isolated landscapes he resides in. In his videos is rarely spoken in, only showing what he experiences. The result are beautiful landscapes with the sounds of roaring winds or the singing of birds in the background.
  </p>

    </p>
    </div>

  <p class="text">
  Some of these videos have millions of viewers. The most popular video of Primitive technology called Primitive Technology: Tiled Roof Hut has more than 65 million views. It seems hard to believe that all these people that are watching for inspiration to eventually go have a similar experience themselves.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  For some reason these videos are very relaxing and I often watch them while lying in bed under a big pile of blankets, with a warm cup of tea. A writer I found online classifies this and similar activities as Domestic Cozy. He describes Domestic Cozy as An upcoming Attitude that can increasingly be seen in the Gen Z generation. He describes it as the desire to stay inside and and engage in relaxing and comforting activities. These activities can be anything as long as they give you comfort. Rather than showing the world what you did or made it is kept in privacy.
  </p>

  <p class="quote">
  “Domestic Cozy finds its best expression in privacy, among friends, rather than in public, among strangers. It prioritizes the needs of the actor rather than the expectations of the spectator. It seeks to predictably control a small, closed environment rather than gamble in a large, open one.”
  </p>

    </p>
    </div>

  <p class="text">
  I interviewed one of my survival friends and asked him why he watched the videos. He replied that it is satisfying to watch someone struggle while you are in a comfortable environment yourself. It gives you a malicious pleasure, but even more It gives you the satisfaction of making or achieving something without actually doing anything for it. It is as if you feed of the experiences of others. I experienced that this can become quite addictive. I can sometimes spend hours behind my laptop watching these videos to give myself a quick rushes of satisfaction and accomplishment. But somehow it is never enough. In the end you just feel useless and a little tricked. It is a like a drug, you keep watching while you never get that full rush of the complete experience and you end up with a depressing feeling wishing you had spend your time better. Watching others from the comfort of your home is, of course, fine. We all need some comfort after a long day at work. But can it possibly replace the real deal, the actual experience?
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  My friends decided (in contradiction to the most of the youtube survivalist watchers) to leave the comfort of their cozy home environments. They ended up staying in the forest for two full weeks, they built their own shelters and even fished to supply themselves with their own meals. Every couple days they would send me short updates on their whereabouts together with a picture. Each time looking more tired and more pale. The enthusiasm I found in the first messages slowly changed into complaining. When I asked how they liked it when they came back they told me it was horrible, being tired and hungry most of the time. Yet, when I asked him if he would ever do it ever again I got a convincing yes.

  <p class="text">
  This is definitely something I can relate to. During my own trip I had multiple moments of discomfort and moments of supposed danger. Strangely enough these moments are the most memorable and valuable to me. Why are these “bad” experiences so strong?
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  The essay Bad is Stronger than Good says that bad events or experiences are in fact stronger than good. They concluded this after comparing multiple researches that were done on this topic. They found that bad experiences resulted in stronger emotional and physical response than good experiences with regard to things like health, social support, and learning.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  Interestingly enough in many of the examined researches they found that these bad experiences had positive after effects. In learning they found that in multiple experiments that punishment (bad experiences) led to faster learning than reward (good experiences). It lead people to search for meaning in order to make sense of the bad experience, more than after a good experience. In another experiment they let people place bets on sport events in which they could either win or lose money. Afterwards the participants were asked their thoughts about the games they bet on. It turned out that the conversations of the people who lost money where significantly longer than from the people who won money. This could mean that there is a greater search for meaning for bad than good outcomes.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  These are some examples on how a bad experience can result into learning. However, When a bad experience is extremely strong it can result in trauma and It might be impossible to overcome its impact and scar you permanently. In my case the bad experience I endured on my trip I would describe as discomfort and were by no means traumatising.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  A widely assumed explanation for this is that it is evolutionary. For example, an animal has more chance to survive if it is aware of dangerous situations (bad experiences). Also, it could prepare for similar (dangerous) experience to prevent from being hurt or killed. On the contrary, if an animal ignores a good event it might miss out on a moment of pleasure or advancement, but in the end it is less likely that something directly terrible will happen.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  During my research I came across a term called the Flow. Flow in psychology refers to a mental state in which a person is completely immersed into an activity. The state of flow is achieved when the balance of challenge and skill is right. If the activity is to easy you lose the state of flow. But if the activity is to hard you also lose the flow state.
  </p>
  <p class="quote">
  "Flow also happens when a person's skills are fully involved in overcoming a challenge that is just about manageable, so it acts as a magnet for learning new skills and increasing challenges. If challenges are too low, one gets back to flow by increasing them. If challenges are too great, one can return to the flow state by learning new skills."
